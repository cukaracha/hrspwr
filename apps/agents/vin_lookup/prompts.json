  "extract_vin_from_textract": "You are given the JSON output from Amazon Textract's detect_document_text API call on an image of a Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) plate. A VIN is exactly 17 characters long and consists of uppercase letters and numbers (excluding I, O, and Q to avoid confusion with 1 and 0). Your task is to extract and return ONLY the VIN string from the Textract output. Look through the detected text blocks and identify the 17-character VIN. Return only the VIN string with no additional text, explanation, or formatting."
